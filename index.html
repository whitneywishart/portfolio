         <p>Here's is where I will have something brilliant to say about putting menus together. For everyday dinners it will be something about considering what you have at home
            and buying whatever organic stuff looks the best. For dinner party planning, it will be something about that flavor book I have and genetic relationships between foods.
            Maybe some stuff about wine pairing and desserts. Maybe some stuff about restaurants too.
